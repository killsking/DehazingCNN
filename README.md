# DehazingCNN
this is a project for paper “Single Image Dehazing Using Deep Convolution Neural Networks”，
we have test the code on ubuntu 14.04 and windows. For windows users, you should change the path.

You need install matconvnet to run this code.


We find that it maybe fail for setup, you can solve this problem by delele it.
